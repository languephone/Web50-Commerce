***********Start in main section****************

******Move to Sublime Text to show models*******

I know we don't have to show code, but this seemed like the best way to show the models in use.

In addition to User, I have 'Listing', which includes methods for returning information about the listing.
Then there's 'Bid', which has a many-to-one relationship with both listing and user.
There's also 'Comment', which also has many-to-one relatioships with listing and user.
Finally, there's 'Watchlist', which has a many-to-many relationship with listing.




******Back to Safari, click 'Add Listing'*******

Now showing the 'Create Listing' functionality.  You can see the fields for 'title', 'Description', 'Starting Bid', 'Image link', and 'Category'.




******Click 'Active Listings'*******

Now shwoing the Active Listings page, which is the default route

******Click in title bar to show route******

Here you can see the Title, description, current price and photo.


Next is the 'Listing' page
******Click 'Universal Geneve...'*******

Here we can see the listing details including title, description, price, seller, date listed, category and comments.

There is a form for bidding.  And at the moment there are no bids, so if I enter a price below the starting price, I will get a specific error.

*******Enter 4,000 and submit******

The error specifically shows that the starting price has not been reached.
Now I'm going to go back and submit the starting price, which is accepted.

Now that there's an existing bid, the next bid must be greater than the existing.
If I try to enter 5,000 again, I get an error.
